## **üöÄ Getting Started**

Follow these instructions to set up and run the project on your local machine.

### **Prerequisites**

- **Node.js**: Version 18.x or higher.
- **MongoDB**: An active MongoDB instance (local or cloud via MongoDB Atlas).
- **Cloudinary Account**: Required for image upload functionality.

### **1\. Clone the Repository**

First, clone the project from GitHub:

git clone https://github.com/shayanblaze/roomifychat.git  
cd roomifychat

### **2\. Install Dependencies**

This project is a monorepo. To install dependencies for both the client and server, run the following command from the root directory:

npm install \--prefix server && npm install \--prefix client

### **3\. Configure Environment Variables**

Create a .env file in both the /server and /client directories by copying the respective .env.example files.

#### **üîπ Server Configuration (/server/.env)**

\# Client URL for CORS  
CLIENT_URL=http://localhost:5173  
DEV_URL=http://127.0.0.1:5173

\# MongoDB Connection URI  
MONGO_URI=your_mongodb_connection_string

\# Secret key for JWT generation  
JWT_SECRET=your_super_secret_jwt_key

\# Port for the server  
PORT=3000

\# Cloudinary Account Credentials  
CLOUDINARY_CLOUD_NAME=your_cloudinary_cloud_name  
CLOUDINARY_API_KEY=your_cloudinary_api_key  
CLOUDINARY_API_SECRET=your_cloudinary_api_secret

#### **üîπ Client Configuration (/client/.env)**

\# Base URL for the backend API  
VITE_API_BASE_URL=http://localhost:3000

### **4\. Run the Application**

To run both the client and server concurrently in development mode, use the following command from the **root directory**:

npm run dev

This will start:

- The backend server on http://localhost:3000
- The React client on http://localhost:5173

You can now open your browser and navigate to http://localhost:5173 to use the application.

## **üìú Available Scripts**

The following scripts are available in the root package.json:

- **npm run dev**: Starts both the client and server in development mode.
- **npm run start**: Starts the server in production mode (requires a prior build).
- **npm run build**: Builds the client application for production.
